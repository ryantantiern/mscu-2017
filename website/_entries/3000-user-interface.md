We have already created a part of our User Interface using IONIC which implies the Login page, Registration page and the Dashboard page. For the design process we have followed [Don Normanâ€™s design principles](https://www.csun.edu/science/courses/671/bibliography/preece.html) and our client requirements focusing on making the user interface clear and easy to use. For the Visibility principle we have tried to show all the functions clearly on the screen and also indicate each step of our app by adding buttons or different icons. Taking under consideration the fact that our most users are visually impaired we also paid attention to the layout and size of the buttons. For the Feedback part we have included a  message in the log in and dashboard page which we are going to try and make it audio in the future. We strongly believe that the audio user-interaction in the case of our app would be extremely important and appreciated by our client. When talking about the Constraints have created alert messages for when the app is not used properly(eg: Fields do not correspond). For the Mapping aspect we are going to make sure that the app will contain a proper relationship between pages using  arrows, icons  and buttons for the routing  between pages.
