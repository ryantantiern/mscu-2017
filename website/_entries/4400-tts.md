Goal: To make the user interaction easier, to guide our users when navigating and also use speech recognition for sharing/saving the routes.

#### Google Cloud Speech API
Cloud Speech is a speech recognition API developed by Google. It uses machine learning to improve its accuracy over time. 

Advantages:
•	Still in beta release, so could be unreliable
•	Recognises over 80 languages
•	Streams text results and return partially completed results
•	Can handle background noise
•	Can be tailored to the context in which the app is used to improve accuracy
•	Works across any device (mobile, web and IoT)

Disadvantages:
•	Not free if monthly usage is above 60 minutes ($0.006 for 15 seconds)
•	Monthly usage capped at 1,000,000 minutes
•	Needs to be used in conjunction with Google text-to-speech to access text-to-speech functionalities


#### Microsoft Bing Speech API

 Bing Speech API is  a cloud-based API that provides advanced algorithms to process spoken language.
Advantages:
•	Recognises intent of speaker, to drive the actions of the application
•	Can return partial recognition results
•	Recognition results are returned in the web-standard JSON format
•	Has both speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities
•	Has many supporting APIs with functionalities such as translating, text analytics, language understanding and speaker recognition

Disadvantages:
•	Price: Free only until up to 5K calls per month. 

## Result
Taking under consideration that our client represents Microsoft and also the  fact that we have to use only one API for speech recognition and text-to-speech recognition, we have decided to for the BING SPEECH API.
