[Mobile Frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_phone_web-based_application_framework) simplify the task of building mobile applications.

<b>[Ionic](http://ionic.io/2)</b> is the top framework for building cross platform mobile applications support by [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/). It is compiles web apps into native apps, thus uses web programming languages such as HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and AngularJS with TypeScript support but also benefits from low latency response like native applications do.. It is Free & Open Source, full cross-platform, advanced native plugins and  well organized documentation.  

### Result

Since our project is an extension of previous work, we had to use the previous technology which was Ionic Cross-platform Mobile Framework. However, Ionic meets all our technological requirements as it supports Bing Maps, and can interact with web APIs.
