A Map API will be required for our project to be able to create and customize a visible a route, and generate directions.

<b>Bing Maps API</b>

The Bing Maps platform provides multiple API options:
The Bing Maps V8 is supported on standard PC & Mac browsers as well as many mobile platforms. This API is ideal for web-based applications with support for JavaScript and TypeScript.

The Bing Maps REST Services are excellent services for performing tasks such as geocoding, reverse-geocoding, routing and static imagery. Being that this is REST-based API, it can be easily accessed from almost any development environment.

<b>Google Maps API</b>

Google Maps APIs are available for Android, iOS, web browsers and via HTTP web services.

By using the Google Maps API, it is possible to embed Google Maps site into an external website, on to which site specific data can be overlaid.

It is a service for retrieving static map images, and web services for performing geocoding, generating driving directions, and obtaining elevation profiles.


### Result

It very much seems that both Bing and Google Maps API can both generate a route which is visible on a map, customize a route by changing the path, and generate directions. Both are free services to use and a very high limit of how many map loads per year.

However, since our client works with Microsoft, and CityScribe uses Bing Maps API, we would be able to attain a lot more support with Bing Maps API.
