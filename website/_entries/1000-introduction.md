Welcome to Microsoft Cities Unlocked team 4â€™s website. We were introduced to the app CityScribe by our client, Jarnail Chudge, which has the features of being able to add annotations to a route on a map. Our client wanted us to adapt this app for the use of the visually impaired community. We explored a few ideas, and after a few meetings with our client and Chris Yates from Guide Dogs, who was able to give us a better insight into the needs of the visually impaired community, we decided to add the feature of being able to create a personal route, and then share it to a friend. This would mean that for example, an instructor would be able to create a route and send it to a visually impaired user. The visually impaired user can then walk through the route following the turn by turn navigation, or listen to the route at home to familiarise themselves with the route.
